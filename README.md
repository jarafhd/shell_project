run the shell scrpit project_one.sh to compile the file project_one.c and run the program.

the shell can read user commands found within the user/bin directory (normal info terminal commands) 
and runs the command through a forked child. it also keeps a running history of inputed commands in a 
wrap around array and prints them out from most recent at the top to the least recent at the bottom when 
the command "history" is entered.
